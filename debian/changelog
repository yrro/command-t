vim-command-t (3.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.

vim-command-t (2.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
  * Reorganize build a bit; invoke targets via upstream's Rakefile rather
    than re-implementing the build & clean targets in debian/rules.
  * Run tests after the build. Apply a couple of patches from upstream git
    to fix some failing tests.
  * Remove nokogiri and mechanize from the Gemfile; their transitive
    dependencies are not in Debian, causing 'bundle' to fail the build;
    however they are not actually required to run the tests (they are only
    used by upstream's upload task).

 -- Sam Morris <sam@robots.org.uk>  Wed, 20 Jan 2016 11:45:47 +0000

vim-command-t (1.13-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Drop versioned build-depends on ruby and ruby-dev; they don't prevent
    version skew caused by trying to use vim-command-t with a version of
    vim that is linked against a different libruby to the one that
    vim-command-t itself was linked against.
  * Update Standards-Version (no changes).
  * Shorten first line of Description.

 -- Sam Morris <sam@robots.org.uk>  Thu, 17 Dec 2015 12:45:08 +0000

vim-command-t (1.13-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Build-depend on both ruby and ruby-dev (the former for extconf.rb, the
    latter for the headers).

 -- Sam Morris <sam@robots.org.uk>  Tue, 24 Nov 2015 11:44:48 +0000

vim-command-t (1.13-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Build-depend on ruby rather than ruby-dev; the expected Ruby version
    stored within metadata.rb is actually taken from the version of the
    interpreter that runs extconf.rb.
  * Use a versioned build-dependency so that the interpreter from the version
    against which vim (in unstable) was built is used.

 -- Sam Morris <sam@robots.org.uk>  Fri, 13 Nov 2015 09:44:26 +0000

vim-command-t (1.13-1) unstable; urgency=low
